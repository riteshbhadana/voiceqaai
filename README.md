# 📚 Foundational AI Research Assistant (RAG + Audio)

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built over
foundational AI research papers that every ML engineer is expected to know.

The system retrieves relevant content from research papers and responds
with both text and audio output.

## Features
- Semantic search using transformer embeddings
- FAISS vector database
- Research paper question answering
- Text-to-speech audio output
- Deployed using Streamlit

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Sentence Transformers
- FAISS
- Streamlit
- gTTS

## Use Case
Ask questions like:
- "What is attention?"
- "Why does dropout work?"
- "Explain encoder-decoder models"

## Note
This system uses publicly available foundational research papers
and does not generate information beyond retrieved content.
